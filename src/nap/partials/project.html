                <p class="paragraph">This project is a custom level for the game Doom II. It has been made using <a href="https://devbuilds.drdteam.org/doombuilder2-gzdb/" class="emphasis link">GZDoom Builder</a>, and is an school exercise for level design.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The scenario is simple: you wake up in an empty cell, and your door is unlocked. As you get out, you notice strange things: the floor is sticky, and your cell neighbour has been hanged... It is up to you to understand what happened here, and to get the hell out!</p>

                <p class="paragraph">After a while, and with good advice from my teacher, I started thinking about a global scenario, and how the lighting was going to tell my story. I quickly got over-enthusiastic, as you can see on the picture on the left (each circle is a light, and this is only the first part of the level).</p>
